## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Being that I've praticed the MERN stack, this project was perfect to be supported by Node.js. The "seats" were created by a large number of checkboxes and change they color based on click evens.

## Lessons Learned:

The big challenge I had here, as simple as it is, was how to best create the seats - and the checkbox seemed like the most straight forward path. I had also considered using individual images, or an SVG of some sort.
